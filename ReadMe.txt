I have started the task on Sunday at around 10:00 AM then at 15:00 I had to do some shopping. 
Then I resumed to do the task at around 17:30 PM and finished at 00:30 AM
By this time the task has been finished but i did not send it for I decided to pick a look at it next day, 
check that it works as per spec and then send it.

from 20:00 PM till 22:00pm i did some insignificant improvements related to introduction of ContextProvider.

Hope you enjoyed validating the app.
